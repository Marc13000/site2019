Being a Theatrepreneur

Until the last decade, sir identified himself as a theatre maker. In 2010 he changed his social media status to a ‘ Theatrepreneur’. He shared how he wanted to do something, which was self-sufficient. He started his own company ‘utopia’ which uses the energy of theatre not only to make productions but also go on to amateur theatre, hold workshops, design and conceptualize events. He explained how they un-theatred theatre. He spoke about how he took theatre to people instead of sticking to just auditoriums. He ended my saying that he would like to give back to society because society has given him a lot.
