          </u></b><br>
            Mr.Ladhani shared an incident which set him on the path of self-learning. He questioned why we even go to college in the first place. People take up a career which are very different from what they have learned. We must do whatever it takes to find out what we love to do. Mr.Ladhani shared how he took on the journey of becoming and entrepreneur and how he grew over the years. He spoke about the importance of being able to communicate and building a network of piers, experts and people wo can hire you. Ultimately to get serious work we have got to demonstrate our skills. He emphasised on how we must design our own education with a goal in mind.
